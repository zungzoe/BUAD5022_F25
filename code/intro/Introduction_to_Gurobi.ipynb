    "This notebook introduces the syntax of formulating a model in Gurobi, specifically showing  a variety of different ways to formulate a Gurobi optimization model.  The initial examples are shown for clarity and for the purposes of showing concrete examples of what the Gurobi statements accomplish.  Later examples are more robust for the purposes of constructing large models and also faster than earlier formulations.  Most of the latter formulations will be sufficiently fast for problems of the scale often encountered in real applications."
