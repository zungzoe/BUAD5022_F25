Subtracting these fixed setup costs from our objective function value of \\\\$5,540 gives a \"true\" profit of \\\\$3,390."

    "# Incorporating Fixed Costs Correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "It should seem reasonable that solving the problem as we just did may not be the best option. Instead, we should take the fixed costs of setting up the machines for each product into account from the beginning. Doing so will allow us to determine if we should **not** produce all three products because the fixed costs may outweigh the profit margins for a particular product.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can incorporate fixed costs by introducing **binary** variables where a 1 will indicate that we decide to produce the particular product and 0 will indicate that we do **not** produce the particular product. It follows, then, that we will need a binary variable for each of the products. Therefore we need to introduce three binary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where will this binary variables show up? Because it costs to set up the machines for an associated product, it should seem obvious that the binary variable will show up in the objective function. The coefficient associated with each binary variable will be the corresponding setup cost for that product. That's the straight-forward part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now need to take care of how many of each product to produce. We know from before that we have upper bounds on each product. Now, we need to make sure that we only produce a product if we have decided to set up the machines for it. That is, if the binary variable is \"on\", i.e. a 1, then we can produce up to the limit as before. If, however, the binary variable is \"off\", i.e. a 0, then we cannot produce any of that product because the machines have not been set up to for a production run of that product. "
