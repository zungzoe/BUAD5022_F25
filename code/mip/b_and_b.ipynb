    "# Branch and Bound Algorithm for Solving Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs) or Binary Integer Programs (BIPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea of the Branch & Bound algorithm is to indirectly arrive at an integer solution by running multiple linear programs that do not have constraints on the integer variables.  Multiple constraints are successively added that in some cases force solutions to have integer decision variables.  \n",
    "- Integer solutions thus obtained may or may not be an optimal solution because the constraints break the preceding model into two parts: the other subpart might have a better solution.  These integer solutions are, therefore, a lower bound (__bound__) on the best possible solution.\n",
    "- Non-integer solutions for a subproblem are possible upper bounds on the best possible objective function value if the solution is less than previous upper bounds (__bound__).\n",
    "- Breaking an existing problem into two with two mutually exclusive but exhaustive constraints is called __branching__.\n",
    "- Termination of a branch: __pruning__\n",
    "  - A branch does not need to investigated further if its solution, either integer or not, when its solution is less than the current lower bound\n",
    "  - A branch does not need to be investigated further if the problem is infeasible: no other subproblems on that branch will be feasible.\n",
    "- Termination of the algorithm\n",
    "  - The optimal solution has been found when the current integer solution has an objective function (lower bound) greater than the solutions on all other branches (which, of course, have been pruned).ted\r\n",
